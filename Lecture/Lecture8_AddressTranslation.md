## Want Processes to Co-exit

+ consider multiprogramming on physical memory

## Multi-step Processing of a Program for Execution

+ Preparation of a program for execution involves components at:
  + Compile time
  + Link time (UNIX “ld” does link)
  + Load time
  + Execution time
+ Addresses can be bound to final values anywhere in this path
  + Depends on hardware support
  + Also depends on operating system
